# Pynasonde
Pynasonde is an open source Python-based computational model of geomagnetic induction on submarine cables. The model is used to estimate the induced voltage in the submarine cables in response to geomagnetic disturbances. It utilizes newly acquired knowledge from magnetotelluric studies and associated investigations of geomagnetically induced currents in power systems.

## Source Code 

The library source code can be found on the [pynasonde GitHub](https://github.com/shibaji7/pynasonde) repository. 

If you have any questions or concerns please submit an **Issue** on the [pynasonde GitHub](https://github.com/shibaji7/pynasonde) repository.
