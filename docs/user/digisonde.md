# DIGISONDE: _Digital Ionospheric Goniometric IonoSONDE_
The Digisonde is a cutting-edge ionospheric radar designed for remote sensing of the ionosphere using high-frequency (HF) radio waves. This technology, rooted in the ionosonde innovation pioneered by Sir Edward Appleton in the late 1920s, stands for `Digital Ionospheric Goniometric IonoSONDE'.

The Digisonde captures a comprehensive range of ionospheric echo parameters, including:
* Amplitude and phase of signals
* Direction of arrival
* Virtual height
* Doppler frequency and spread
* Polarization (ordinary and extraordinary waves)

From these ionospheric echoes, the Digisonde provides:
* **Electron Density Profiles**: Near real-time ionospheric electron density profiles with error bars for each height.
* **Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC)**: Precise measurements of ionospheric electron content.
* **Classical Ionospheric Characteristics**: Real-time parameters such as foF2, foF1, foE, foEs, MUF(3000)F2, hmF2, hmF1, hmE, and the IRI parameters B0 and B1.

Additionally outputs are following:
* E and F region drifts. 
* Near real-time radio skymaps of ionospheric reflection points for vertical and oblique Digisonde-to-Digisonde sounding.

The Digisonde is an indispensable tool for real-time ionospheric monitoring, enabling advanced research and operational forecasting of ionospheric conditions.
