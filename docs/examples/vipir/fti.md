# VIPIR FTI Interval Plot Example

This example demonstrates how to turn a directory of VIPIR NGI ionogram files into
an O-mode frequencyâ€“time interval (FTI) plot suitable for documentation.
The workflow lives in `examples/vipir/fti.py` and is intended to be customised
with your own campaign archive or station of interest.

## Prerequisites

- A collection of VIPIR NGI files organised by day, e.g.
  `<root>/<year>/<doy>/ionogram/*.ngi[.bz2]`.
- `pynasonde` dependencies installed (see `docs/user/install.md`).
- Optional: set `VIPIR_SPEED_DEMON_ROOT` to the base directory of your archive to
  avoid editing the script.

## Running the example

```bash
export VIPIR_SPEED_DEMON_ROOT=/path/to/your/station/individual
python examples/vipir/fti.py
```

The script will copy a day's worth of ionograms into `/tmp/vipir_fti/`,
generate a flattened RTI dataframe with `generate_fti_profiles`, and create a
figure inside `docs/examples/figures/`. Inspect `fig_file_name` and `flim`
arguments in the call to tune the output path and frequency window.

## Using the helper directly

```python
from examples.vipir.fti import generate_fti_profiles

rti = generate_fti_profiles(
    folder="/path/to/ngi/files",
    fig_file_name="docs/examples/figures/my_fti.png",
    fig_title="My Campaign / 2024-03-21",
    stn="WI937",
    flim=(3.5, 4.5),
)
```

`rti` is a long-form dataframe containing time, range, and the mode-specific
power/noise columns, so you can perform additional filtering or statistics
before or after plotting.
