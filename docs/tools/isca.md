# AutoScale-ISCA: _Automatic Ionogram Scaler using Image Segmentation and Clustering Analysis_
`AutoScale-ISCA` is a powerful tool within Pynasonde that automatically scales ionograms by leveraging advanced machine learning, image segmentation techniques, and clustering analysis. It provides a seamless, accurate way to identify and extract key ionospheric parameters, removing the need for manual scaling and enhancing data processing efficiency. Ideal for researchers and space weather analysts, `AutoScale-ISCA` ensures reliable and precise ionospheric data interpretation.
