"""DFT datatypes used by the Digisonde DFT parser.

This module defines small `dataclass` containers that mirror the on-disk
DFT record structures used by Digisonde DFT-format files. The classes are
lightweight holders for parsed fields and provide small normalization steps
in ``__post_init__`` where appropriate.

These types are intended to be used by the parser code under
``pynasonde.digisonde.parsers.dft`` and by higher-level utilities that need
structured access to the parsed header and spectral data.
